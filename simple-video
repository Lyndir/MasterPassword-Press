So what's the big deal about
    PASSWORDS?

Well, you know this already, but
    PASSWORDS
        REALLY
            SUCK

Why is that?  Why do passwords make us suffer so much and why do we put up with them?

It's all about keeping
    sneaky Pete
or jerks like
    Bob
out of our accounts.

So it's been generally accepted that a good way of doing that is by having the website ask you a
    SECRET
when you try to get in.

The assumption is that
    ONLY
        YOU
could possibly know the secret, so the website assumes that a correct secret means it's
    REALLY YOU
        BEHIND THE KEYBOARD

It all sort of falls or stands with how
    SECURE
your passwords really are.

If you use
    Susan1983
as the password for all your sites,
it won't be long before Pete and Bob catch on.

Really, it's easy to make secure passwords.  Anyone can do it!

But then comes the suck.
It's assumed that you can
    REMEMBER
all your passwords.

And that tends to be
    REALLY
        BLOODY
            HARD.

Never mind remembering them. Just
    COMING UP
with a good password is a
    PAINFUL
exercise.

Especially when you use
    SECURE
passwords for
    ALL YOUR SITES
and...
    A DIFFERENT ONE
        FOR EACH.

Because, you know, when you don't, how long until the admins of
    4chan.org
try your password there to get into your
    gmail.com?

So what are you supposed to do?

As we do more and more things online,
we're asked for more and more passwords.

A password to share your pictures,
A password to talk to your friends,
A password to watch movies,
A password to read the news,
And every few days, a new site and a new password.

They all tell us:
Don't use easy-to-guess passwords,
like a date of birth or a relative's name.
But how are you supposed to think of this many good passwords?
And how are you expected to remember them?

Multiple solutions have been formulated:
Write them down in a notebook.
Keep them in a vault program.
Save them in the cloud.

However, these solutions only help with remembering,
not with making good passwords.
And did you consider what's going to happen,
when the notebook gets lost,
the vault program corrupted,
or the cloud company hacked?

You don't need to take these risks.
Master Password is a solution that was designed
to take the trouble and worry out of passwords.

First and foremost, passwords must be secure.
That means really long and full of funny stuff.
In fact, the harder it is to remember your passwords,
the better they probably are.

Secondly, it should be easy to type your passwords.
Long and funny usually means a pain to type,
especially on those smaller mobile keyboards.
Master Password's passwords were designed
so that your mind can split them up into chunks,
allowing you to easily type in chunk by chunk.

Thirdly, to make sure nobody can discover your passwords,
and to make sure there's no risk of you losing your passwords,
your passwords must not rely on any kind of storage.
No storage, means nothing to lose.
Master Password calculates your site's password from scratch
each time you ask for it.

So if you drop your phone off a cliff
while rock-climbing in Yosemite National Park,
just get a new one, install Master Password,
and it'll give you all your passwords back.
No sync, no internet, no backups.
