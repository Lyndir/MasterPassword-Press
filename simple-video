As we do more and more things online,
we're asked for more and more passwords.

A password to share your pictures,
A password to talk to your friends,
A password to watch movies,
A password to read the news,
And every few days, a new site and a new password.

They all tell us:
Don't use easy-to-guess passwords,
like a date of birth or a relative's name.
But how are you supposed to think of this many good passwords?
And how are you expected to remember them?

Multiple solutions have been formulated:
Write them down in a notebook.
Keep them in a vault program.
Save them in the cloud.

However, these solutions only help with remembering,
not with making good passwords.
And did you consider what's going to happen,
when the notebook gets lost,
the vault program corrupted,
or the cloud company hacked?

You don't need to take these risks.
Master Password is a solution that was designed
to take the trouble and worry out of passwords.

First and foremost, passwords must be secure.
That means really long and full of funny stuff.
In fact, the harder it is to remember your passwords,
the better they probably are.

Secondly, it should be easy to type your passwords.
Long and funny usually means a pain to type,
especially on those smaller mobile keyboards.
Master Password's passwords were designed
so that your mind can split them up into chunks,
allowing you to easily type in chunk by chunk.

Thirdly, to make sure nobody can discover your passwords,
and to make sure there's no risk of you losing your passwords,
your passwords must not rely on any kind of storage.
No storage, means nothing to lose.
Master Password calculates your site's password from scratch
each time you ask for it.

So if you drop your phone off a cliff
while rock-climbing in Yosemite National Park,
just get a new one, install Master Password,
and it'll give you all your passwords back.
No sync, no internet, no backups.
